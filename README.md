# Make a Band App

With this simple application you can manage the data of a pop rock band's members. You can add new band members, enter name and instruments they play on, specify if the person is a singer or not, and then filter all singers by pressing the "Show me the singers!' button.

The application was created in 2016, but refactored, moved under MERN stack ( http://mern.io/ ) and uploaded to github in 2018.

## Install steps

1. Go to https://github.com/Hashnode/mern-starter to clone or download MERN Starter.

2. Download this repo's files, overwrite MERN Starter files with them correspondingly.

3. Make sure your MongoDB is running.

4. Run npm install.

5. Run npm start.

### Notes
Make a Band App does not introduce any new node module dependency other than MERN Starter's.
